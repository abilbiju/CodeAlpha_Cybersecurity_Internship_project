# Cybersecurity Tools and Resources

Welcome to the Code Alpha Cybersecurity Internship project repository! This repository contains scripts, presentations, and tools designed to enhance your knowledge and skills in cybersecurity, specifically in the areas of network intrusion detection, phishing awareness, and traffic sniffing.

## Contents

### 1. Intrusion Detection with Suricata (`intrusion.sh`)
A bash script that configures Suricata, an open-source network threat detection engine, to monitor network traffic. This script allows you to define your home network, set up rules, and log potential threats such as ping floods, SSH brute force attacks, and port scans.

**Features:**
- Automated configuration of Suricata with custom rules.
- Alerts for various network threats.
- Real-time logging of detected threats.

### 2. Phishing Awareness Presentation (`Phishing Awareness.pptx`)
A comprehensive presentation on phishing, covering various types of phishing attacks, how to recognize phishing emails and websites, and strategies for reporting phishing attempts.

**Key Points:**
- Overview of phishing and its different forms (Email Phishing, Spear Phishing, Whaling, Smishing, Vishing).
- Tips on identifying phishing emails and suspicious websites.
- Guidance on how to report phishing incidents.

### 3. Basic Network Sniffer (`sniffer_basic.py`)
A Python script that acts as a basic network sniffer, capturing and displaying network packets. This tool is essential for understanding the nature of traffic on your network and detecting potential anomalies.

**Capabilities:**
- Capture packets over the network.
- Display packet details for analysis.
- Useful for learning and demonstrating the basics of network traffic analysis.

## How to Use

### Intrusion Detection with Suricata
1. Run the `intrusion.sh` script to configure Suricata.
2. Provide your network's IP address and subnet when prompted.
3. Monitor the `fast.log` for real-time alerts.

### Phishing Awareness Presentation
- Open the `Phishing Awareness.pptx` file using any presentation software.
- Review the slides to educate yourself and others about phishing threats.

### Basic Network Sniffer
- Run the `sniffer_basic.py` script using Python 3.
- The script will start capturing and displaying network packets.
